# Gumpress
Gumpress is a woocommerce extension for importing Gumroad products to
your woocommerce site. It enables you to create custom gumroad store front using any woocommerce
theme.

Your customer can buy your gumroad products from your woocommerce website. Gumpress
replaces woocommerce's default buy button (checkout system) with gumroad checkout popup.

Whenever you update your gumroad product(product thumbnail, description, price, etc)
you just need to press "Sync products" in your wordpress admin panel. And all of your products
will be syncronized instantly.

Gumpress also syncronizes your gumroad products versions with woocommerce variable product.
